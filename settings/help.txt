Undo/Redo
â—�

Undo and Redo are classic features, allowing you to undo the previous action taken. This will
result in any changes made to certain task(s) being restored. A maximum of 10 consecutive
actions are possible for both undo and redo. For example:

â—�

â��

delete Dinner with Mom (Task with Dinner with Mom is deleted)

â��

Undo (Task Dinner with Mom is restored with all its previous details)

However, when undo is implemented at least once, any new commands (other than undo and
redo) will discard all saved redo actions after the new action has been implemented. For example:

â—�

delete Fix lightbulb (Task â€œfix lightbulbâ€� is deleted)

â—�

undo (Task â€œfix lightbulbâ€� is restored)

â—�

add Meeting with boss (Task â€œMeeting with bossâ€� is added)

â—�

redo (No tasks to redo, previously undone actions are cleared.)

Block Multiple Timeslot

Prioritise
This feature allows you to mark certain tasks as important. These tasks will be displayed with a logo
