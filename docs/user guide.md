# Feature Details

## Add

To create a new task, **Add** or **Create** are the command words, with the task name following thereafter, ie "Dinner with Mum"

Use **Command Tags** to add in details for the task, "**at**" for time, "**@**" for location, etc. For the **full list of Command Tags**, refer to [Shortcuts](#shortcuts)

Tasks are separated into 3 categories, Events, Deadlines and Floatings. 
* Event: Task is given with a start time and end time.
Example: _**Add** Dinner with Mum **at** 23/3/2016 7:00pm to 9:00pm_
	* If only a start time is given, then end time will automatically be set to 1 hour after the start time. 

* Deadline: Task is given with only an end time.
Example: _**Add** Return home **by** 23/3/2016 7:00pm_

* Floating: Task is given with no start time and end time. 
Example: _**Add** Dinner with Mum_

## Delete

To delete an existing task, **Delete**, **Del**, **Erase** or **Remove** are the command words that can be used to delete a task. Note that deleting a task _IS NOT_ completing a task. 

Specify the task number, the task description or simply highlight the task to be deleted. 

Example:
* _**Mark** Dinner with Mum_
* _**Done** 4_

## Mark as Completed

To mark a task as done, **Done**, **Completed**, **Do**, **Mark**, **Finish**, **Fin** are the command words that can be used. 

Similar to [Delete](#delete), specify the task number, the task description or simply highlight the task to be marked as completed.

Example:
* _**Mark** Dinner with Mum_
* _**Done** 3_

## Edit

To edit an existing task, **Edit**, **Update**, **Change** and **Mod** are the commands that can be used. 

Use **Command Tags** to change details for the task, "**at**" for time, "**@**" for location, etc. For the **full list of Command Tags**, refer to [Shortcuts](#shortcuts)

If the task already has those details, then the new details will overwrite the old details. 

Similar to [Delete](#delete) and [Mark as Completed](#mark-as-completed), specify the task number, the task description or simply highlight the task to be edited.

Example: 
* _**Change** Dinner with Mum **@** NEX
* _**Edit** 4 Dinner with Mum and Dad

## Search

To search for a word, **Search**, **Fine**, **Show**, **View** or **List** are the commands that can be used. 

**#** searches for the tags, and thereafter displaying the tasks.
* When searching for **#cow**, tasks with tags **#cows** and **#cowmilk** will also appear in the search result.
