Urgenda allows you to select different tasks using a selector by moving up or down. You can use CTRL + UP or CTRL + DOWN to move your selection to a task that you wish to perform a command on. Try it after the demo!

In Urgenda, we make managing different tasks effortless for you by allowing you to find important tasks quickly. Tasks are colour coded to let you know which ones need to be settled first.   					
Overdue tasks are shown in red to let you know you need to get them completed ASAP!

All tasks that are due by or happen on today are shown in yellow, for you to take note of all your activities for the day!		
Events today that have passed are marked with a strikethrough to let you know they are over!

All other tasks that happen after today are shown in blue.

Tasks that are completed and marked as done are shown in grey. You can view these task by using the command 'archive'!

Have an important event or deadline to jot down? Easy!
Urgenda can detect different date formats such as "11/4", "11 Apr" or "11 April"! You can even use words like 'today', 'tonight' or 'tommorrow'!

Have a deadline to meet? Add the given deadline task to Urgenda using:
Complete tutorial by [date and time to complete task by]

Got an upcoming event? Add the given event task to Urgenda using:
Breakfast with mum and dad today from 7am to 8am

Urgenda also supports adding of tasks with no specified dates or times! To add such a task, simply type the description and press ENTER!

When a task is completed, use "done" or "completed" to mark it as completed! The completed task will then be moved to your archive!

There are also other exciting features in Urgenda that can help you manage your tasks better!
For tasks that are important, use "Important" or "Pri" to prioritize and mark it with a star! All prioritized tasks are shown first.

To add a location to a task, simply add "@" followed by the location description! For example, use "@Supermarket" to add this location!

Have an upcoming event that doesn't have a confirmed date and time yet? Urgenda allows you to reserve multiple timeslots for the same task!
Simple use "block" or "reserve" followed by the timeslots that you wish to reserve for this event!
The number of timeslots blocked is shown at the right side of the task!

If you wish to expand a task to see its details, such as its date added and modified, the multiple reserved timeslots, or the set location, simple use "showmore"!
